# Project: Create a 30 Days App
## General App Guidelines
- Decide on a theme and create 30 tips related to this theme. One tip for each day of the month.
- At a minimum, each tip should contain relevant text and an image.
- The tips need to be displayed in a scrollable list (column or row) or a scrollable grid.
- Follow Material Design guidelines to create a distinct brand for the app.
